          <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
          <p>As the robotics industry progressed, they became a part of the consumer products,  home environment, and education.
            They are an integral part of the life experience of individuals, families, and communities. The potential benefits of robots are explicit. 
            However, there is a need for consideration and exploration of potential security and privacy risks of future robots.
            They could present new or increase existing security problems for homes and classroom environments.
            The purpose of this project is to investigate these potential security and privacy issues and explore solutions to these issues. 
            We believe that while the industry of social robotics is relatively new, it is the ideal time to examine
            the security and privacy vulnerabilities of robots, as well as AI ethics in homes and educational institutions.</p>

          <p>Our research consists of three parts.
            First, we build a foundation for our study that includes experimental analysis of Zumi, a new educational smart robotic car, for security and privacy vulnerabilities through Zumi’s Python software codebase. 
            Here we examine potential attacks and abuse of Zumi’s vulnerabilities, like data theft, data loss, loss of data integrity, malfunction, and full system compromise.
            Second, we process the results of our experimental analyses.
            Lastly, we use our experiments to design a set of rational solutions, such as creating a Privacy Label and designing an application - Privacy label check that can read a label.
            In closing, we present our analysis to the public through a developed website aiming to inform and protect users’ privacy.</p>
